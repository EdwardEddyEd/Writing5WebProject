During my Freshmen Fall, my writing professor requested my classmates and I to create an e-portfolio
of our essays using Instructure's Canvas. Using a rich-text-editor, my first 3 essays were simple to put up.
However, our final 10 page multi-modal paper required us to also embed videos or images.
Our professor stated that if we knew some basic HTML and CSS, we would be able to complete the project
easily. Unfortunately I did not know any HTML or CSS, so I resorted to continuing using the rich-text editor. 
In the end, I was not able to create the clean webpage I had hoped to make.

Now, about a year later, I wanted to remake the whole project to help develop and test my HTML and CSS skills.
Although the site is very simple in design and lacks any bells and whistles, I was able to recreate the
design I had envisioned for my e-portfolio. However, please note that my essays may not be breathtakingly outstanding.
